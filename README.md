# Lissajous-Curve-in-CProcessing
Messing around with CProcessing (created for Digipen students).
Followed Dan Shiffman's Lissajous tutorial in Processing with changes:
* I only have one curve shown instead of a grid of 10 curves.
* When you press WASD or Arrow Keys, controller curves will increase in speed.
* Due to the nature of C instead of Java, I'm not using an "ArrayList" (or any form of dynamic array).
* Due to the nature of this being a simply sandbox concept, I'm not putting finess or dedication into it.

Thanks for visiting this repo!
